		// Given two sides of a triangle (t1_a, t1_b) we compute the third (t1_c).
		// The code below is repetitive. Write a function, "triangle", which takes in two sides of
		// a triangle and returns the third using the equation repeated below.

		// Then, convert the code below to use the new "triangle" function instead of repeating the
		// equation three times.

		function triangle(a, b) {
			return Math.sqrt((a * a) + (b * b));
		}
		console.log(triangle(3, 4));
		console.log(triangle(5, 18));
		console.log(triangle(9, 12));
