# Product Site Challenge

Your assignment is to work individually to produce a website to sell a product. It can be a product that already exists (this is easier since you'll have source material like images and marketing copy) or you can make up your own product.

The website should be just one page - feel free to add links to other pages, but we won't expect you to build those other pages.

The site should make use of images and css to market the product. You are welcome to use pre-built scripts and styles. We don't expect any sort of fancy javascript functionality. (Use what you've learned in this week.)

We'll be demoing these sites monday morning. So make sure to design a site you think you could build this weekend while still getting time to relax (and work on your personal portfolio page).

Some product ideas for you:
* https://www.apple.com/iphone/
* http://starbucks.com
* http://www.gucci.com/us/en/
* https://www.oculus.com/en-us/
* http://illegalpetes.com/
* http://bhaktichai.com/

## Optional Extra Direction

If you'd like, you can use the app at https://myclientwants.herokuapp.com to generate a list of requirements for your website.

If you get done with your product site early, you can use this to generate other website ideas for good practice!

## Extra points for

 * Bootstrap image carousel or similar
 * Fixed or absolutely positioned elements
 * Well-formatted CSS and HTML with comments
