# TODO

* Button to feed each pet ✅
* Add limits to how hungry / happy a pet can be ✅ (Still need to separate these functions from the interval)
* Be able to enter (somehow) how much food / fun we want to give a pet ✅
* Clear out the name input field when we create a new pet ✅
* Have the pets slowly get hungry / bored over time ✅

Also, anything you want to add!

* Create an HTML template to get the HTML out of JS.
* Create a kill function to kill pets if hunger gets to high.
